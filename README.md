# KCalc-project
Kcalc is an open source(GPL v3.0) calculator for desktop, it features basic arithmatical operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, though I planned to add more operations down the line 

### CHANGE LOG

V1.0: Fixed "int literal" error

V2.0: Background optimization, bug fix, GUI medernization, added support for decimal numbers [example: 5.12]

V3.0: Add new operation "^" a.k.a "x to the power of y"

### Errors

V3.0: "int literal" error has comeback,its an non-fatal console error(this means that the app will work as intended even when the error is triggered),it will be fixed when V3.1 rolled out
