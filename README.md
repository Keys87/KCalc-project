# KCalc-project
Kcalc is an open source(GPL v3.0) calculator for desktop, it features basic arithmatical operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, though I planned to add more operations down the line 

### CHANGE LOG

V1.0: Fixed "int literal" error

V2.0: Background optimization, bug fix, GUI medernization, added support for decimal numbers [example: 5.12]

V3.0: Add new operation "^" a.k.a "x to the power of y"

V4.0: Add new operation "âˆš" a.k.a "square root of x"

V5.0: support for commas as seperator when inputting the numbers, example (one thousand = 1,000) but (one point zero = 1.0) and this (one thousand point zero = 1,000.0)

### Errors

V3.0 +: "int literal" error has comeback, its a non-fatal console error(this means that the app will work as intended even when the error is triggered), it won't be fixed
